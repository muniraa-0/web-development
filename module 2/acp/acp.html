        <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications that run online. It involves
        everything from the visual design of a site (front-end) to the behind-the-scenes coding and database management that
        make it functional (back-end). Key tasks include coding with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, managing data,
        ensuring security, optimizing for speed, and creating an engaging user experience.</p>
